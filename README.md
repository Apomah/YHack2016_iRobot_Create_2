This web application utilizes Python, Flask for Python, AJAX, JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jsDraw2D, jQuery, jQuery UI, and the Open Create platform in order to control the Roomba robot via USB port through a HTML file. A movable "joystick", controlled by the mouse, is used to set the speed and direction for the wheels while sensor data is printed and the robot's trajectory is mapped.


To use (Linux):  
Install Flask Python module (pip install Flask)  
Navigate to folder (I.e. cd Documents/YHack2016_iRobot2016_Create_2)  
Run in terminal (without quotes) "sudo python finalserver.py"  
Type the URL given after running the command into your browser of choice
